        <source>The text content might have inconsistent encoding within a single document. Delete any parts with erroneous encoding.

Remove all content that lacks corresponding audio segments, such as titles, markers, instructions, and comments. However, leave onomatopoeia intact.

Rate your editing on a scale of 1 to 5 stars based on the following criteria:

1 star: Edited without listening to the audio. Removed titles, markers, comments, etc.
2 stars: Skimmed through the audio.
3 stars: Roughly verified that each line has a corresponding audio segment.
4 stars: Listened to the audio and corrected the text line by line.
5 stars: Carefully listened to the audio and corrected the text word by word.

Use submit button to submit an editing, skip button to randomly skip to another editing, and mismatch button to mark the editing as a audio text mismatch.

Note:
- If you are unsure about the correctness of the text, rate it lower.
- In the editor, you can hold shift-alt and mouse left key to select vertically. Useful for scenarios like deleting timestamps.
- You can skip special symbols like ♡, those will be removed when doing post processing.</source><target state="final">The text content might have inconsistent encoding within a single document. Delete any parts with erroneous encoding.
